This repository demonstrates a common Swift coding error and its solution. The `bug.swift` file shows incorrect function usage, resulting in a type mismatch error. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides a corrected version with proper type handling and error prevention. This example is useful for understanding type safety in Swift and best practices for preventing such errors.
